# Mini_project 2
 To demonstrate dynamic state management and event handling in React using functional components and hooks.

 - When the user clicks the "-" button, the counter decreases.
 - React automatically updates the UI whenever the state changes.

 ##  Features

 - Increment and decrement counter functionality
